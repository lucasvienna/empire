## 1. Project Overview

Empire is the server backend for a base-building multi-client game built in Rust. It handles data,
storage, scheduled tasks, and all logic in a server-authoritative manner. Key components:

- **domain**: Core data structures (DB, business, etc)
- **game**: Main game logic and routines
- **net**: Networking utilities and server scaffolding
- **controllers**: REST API routers & controllers

**Golden Rule**: When unsure about implementation details or requirements, ALWAYS consult the
developer rather than making assumptions.

## 2. Non-Negotiable Golden Rules

| #   | AI _may_ do                                                                                                                                                                                         | AI _must NOT_ do                                                                                                                                      |

| G-1 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.                                                                           | ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-2 | Generate code **only inside** relevant source directories (e.g., `src/game/` for the main API, `migrations/` for the SQL blueprints, `crates/` for non-core libraries) or explicitly pointed files. | ❌ Touch `tests/`, `AGENTS.md`, or any `test` modules (humans own tests & specs).                                                                     |
| G-3 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code.                                                                                                                          | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                                                                                       |
| G-4 | Follow Rust formatting (`rustfmt.toml`) and use `cargo fmt` for code formatting.                                                                                                                    | ❌ Re-format code to any other style or manually format instead of using tooling.                                                                     |
| G-5 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.                                                                                                                                         | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                                                                                     |
| G-6 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.                                                                                                             | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.                                                                        |

---

## 4. Rust Coding Standards

- **Rust Version**: 1.87+, use stable features unless explicitly requiring nightly
- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` with project's `rustfmt.toml` configuration
- **Naming**: `snake_case` (functions/variables), `PascalCase` (structs, types, traits),
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` ( constants)
- **Error Handling**: Prefer `Result<T, E>` and `?` operator. Use `anyhow` for application errors,
  custom error types for domain errors
- **Documentation**: Use `///` for public APIs, `//` for implementation details
- **Testing**: Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for unit tests within source files, separate integration
  tests in `tests/` directory. Use `axum-test` for API endpoint testing
- **Tracing**: Use `#[instrument]` macro for tracing in public methods. Skip sensitive parameters
  with `#[instrument(skip(password))]`. Follow consistent logging levels per
  `docs/tracing_guidelines.md`

**Error Handling Patterns**:

```rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use crate::domain::error::GameError;

// For application-level functions
async fn process_game_data() -> Result<GameData> {
	let raw_data = fetch_data().await
		.context("Failed to fetch game data")?;

	parse_game_data(raw_data)
		.context("Failed to parse game data")
}

// For domain-specific errors
fn validate_building_placement(building: &Building) -> Result<(), GameError> {
	if !building.is_valid_position() {
		return Err(GameError::InvalidBuildingPlacement);
	}
	Ok(())
}
```

## 5. Project Layout & Core Components

| Directory     | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/`     | DEV and PROD default configuration                 |
| `crates/`     | Large modules that became library crates           |
| `docs/`       | Markdown specs for the game                        |
| `migrations/` | SQL table definitions and data seeds               |
| `scripts/`    | Quick setup and maintenance scripts for local work |
| `src/`        | Main source code root                              |
| `tests/`      | Integration tests                                  |

### Core Modules

- **domain/**: Business logic and data models (Player, Building, Resource, Modifier, Job)
- **game/**: Game-specific logic including resource processing, building services, and modifier
  systems
- **controllers/**: REST API endpoints organized by feature (auth, game, health, player, user)
- **db/**: Database models and connection handling using Diesel ORM
- **net/**: Networking layer with Axum web framework
- **auth/**: Authentication and session management
- **job_queue/**: Async task processing system

**Key Domain Models**:

- **Player**: The users aka players of the game
- **Building**: Individual constructions in the player's realm
- **Resource**: A consumable supply, used for buildings and troops
- **Modifier**: A numeric unit that affects other systems
- **Job**: An async task to be executed at a given point in time

**Key Technologies & Dependencies**:

- **axum**: Web framework for REST API
- **diesel**: ORM for PostgreSQL interactions with connection pooling
- **tokio**: Async runtime
- **serde**: JSON serialization/deserialization
- **anyhow**: Error handling
- **uuid/ulid**: Unique identifiers
- **tracing**: Structured logging and telemetry

### Database

- PostgreSQL with migrations in `migrations/` directory
- Schema auto-generated in `src/schema.rs`
- Uses Diesel ORM with connection pooling
- Docker setup for development environment

**Seeding Strategy**: Hybrid approach separating schema from data

- **Migrations** (`migrations/`): Schema structure + critical reference data (factions, core
  building definitions)
- **Seeds** (`seeds/`): Extended configuration data (building levels, resources, future items/tech
  trees)
  - Seeds are SQL files executed in alphabetical order by `empire::db::seeds::run()`
  - All seeds are idempotent using unique constraints + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  - Seeds run automatically in tests via `tests/common/mod.rs`
  - Use numeric prefixes to control execution order (e.g., `003_items.sql`)
  - Add unique constraints to tables in migrations
  - Commit seed files to version control for game balance tracking

---

## 6. Anchor Comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase for inline knowledge that can be easily
`grep`ped.

### Guidelines:

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI
  and developers
- Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars)
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in
  relevant subdirectories
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction
- Add relevant anchor comments whenever code is:
  - Complex or non-obvious
  - Performance-critical
  - Part of a larger architectural pattern
  - Contains potential gotchas or edge cases

Example:

```rust
// AIDEV-NOTE: Performance hotpath - avoid allocations in game loop
async fn update_all_buildings(buildings: &mut [Building]) -> Result<()> {
	// ... implementation
}

// AIDEV-TODO: Consider using a more efficient data structure for large player counts
type PlayerMap = std::collections::HashMap<PlayerId, Player>;
```

## 7. Commit Discipline

- **Granular commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Tag AI-generated commits**: e.g., `feat: optimize resource calculation [AI]`
- **Clear commit messages**: Follow conventional commits format, explain the _why_
- **Use `git worktree`** for parallel/long-running AI branches
- **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand

Example commit messages:

```
feat: add building upgrade validation [AI]
fix: resolve race condition in resource updates [AI]
refactor: extract common game loop logic [AI]
```

## 8. Key File & Pattern References

**API Route Definitions**:

- Location: `src/controllers/` (e.g., `src/controllers/auth.rs`, `src/controllers/game.rs`)
- Pattern: Axum routers with handler functions, request/response structs, middleware

**Error Types**:

- Location: `src/domain/error.rs`
- Pattern: Custom error enums implementing `std::error::Error`, conversion with `From<>`

**Domain Models**:

- Location: `src/domain/` (e.g., `src/domain/player.rs`, `src/domain/building.rs`)
- Pattern: Structs with validation, serde derives, database mappings

**Database Schema**:

- Location: `migrations/` (Diesel migrations) and `src/schema.rs` (generated schema)
- Pattern: Diesel ORM with connection pooling, repository pattern for data access

**Game Logic**:

- Location: `src/game/` (core game systems and rules)
- Pattern: Service structs with business logic, event-driven updates

---

## 9. Common Rust Patterns in This Project

**Resource Management**:

```rust
// Use RAII and Drop trait for cleanup
struct GameSession {
	db_conn: DbConnection,
	// ... other resources
}

impl Drop for GameSession {
	fn drop(&mut self) {
		// Cleanup happens automatically
	}
}
```

**Async Patterns**:

```rust
// Use async/.await consistently
async fn process_player_action(action: PlayerAction) -> Result<GameState> {
	let validation = validate_action(&action).await?;
	let new_state = apply_action(validation).await?;
	save_state(&new_state).await?;
	Ok(new_state)
}
```

**Configuration**:

```rust
// Use config crate for environment-based configuration
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct DatabaseConfig {
	url: String,
	max_connections: u32,
}
```

## 10. Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

- **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them
- If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**
- If you make significant changes to a directory's structure or patterns, **document these in its
  `AGENTS.md`**
- If a directory lacks an `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic worth documenting, **suggest
  creating one**

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

- **Ownership Issues**: Forgetting to consider Rust's ownership model when designing APIs
- **Async Context**: Not properly handling async contexts and potential blocking operations
- **Error Propagation**: Using `unwrap()` or `expect()` instead of proper error handling
- **Database Connections**: Not properly managing connection pools or transactions
- **Performance**: Creating unnecessary allocations in hot code paths
- **Testing**: Writing tests that don't account for async behavior or database state

---

## 12. Domain-Specific Terminology

- **Player**: A user account that owns buildings and resources in the game
- **Building**: A structure that produces resources or provides game benefits
- **Resource**: Materials like wood, stone, gold that are consumed and produced
- **Realm**: A player's territory containing their buildings
- **Modifier**: Temporary or permanent effects that change game mechanics
- **Job**: Scheduled background tasks (building construction, resource production)

---

## 13. Development Workflow

### Setup Steps

1. Use `./scripts/init_db.sh` to set up database (runs migrations + seeds automatically)
2. Run `cargo test` to verify setup
3. Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing
4. Follow tracing guidelines for logging
5. Add migrations for schema changes using Diesel CLI
6. Add reference data to `seeds/` directory (see `seeds/README.md` for conventions)

### AI Assistant Workflow

When responding to user instructions, follow this process:

1. **Consult Guidance**: Review relevant `AGENTS.md` files for the request
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ask targeted questions if requirements are unclear
3. **Plan & Break Down**: Create a rough plan referencing project conventions
4. **Execute or Confirm**: For trivial tasks, proceed immediately; for complex tasks, present plan
   for review
5. **Track Progress**: Use internal to-do lists for multi-step tasks
6. **Re-plan if Stuck**: Return to planning phase if blocked
7. **Update Documentation**: Update anchor comments and documentation after completion
8. **Request Review**: Ask user to review completed work
9. **Session Boundaries**: Suggest fresh session if context becomes unclear

---

## 14. Files to NOT Modify

These files control which files should be ignored by AI tools:

- `.agentignore`: Specifies files ignored by IDE (build directories, logs, caches, etc.)
- `.agentindexignore`: Controls IDE indexing exclusions for performance

**Never modify these ignore files** without explicit permission. When adding new files, check these
patterns to ensure proper indexing.

[^1]:
    This principle emphasizes human oversight for critical aspects like architecture, testing, and
    domain-specific decisions, ensuring AI assists rather than fully dictates development.
