# Mechanics
## Factions
There are 3 factions: humans, orcs, and elves. They share most of the same
functionality, with some buffs to differentiate them.

### Humans
The classic race. Humans have bonuses to Wood and Cavalry.

#### Passives

- +15% Wood production
- +15% Cavalry training speed
- +25% Cavalry DMG/DEF

### Orcs
Green-skinned giants, a very tribalistic society with bonuses to Stone and
Infantry.

#### Passives

- +15% Stone production
- +15% Infantry training speed
- +15% Infantry DMG/DEF

### Elves
Tall, silver-haired immortals. Elves are in tune with nature and have bonuses
to Food and Ranged units.

#### Passives

- +15% Food production
- +15% Ranged training speed
- +15% Ranged DMG/DEF

## Resources
There are four resources that the player can gather and spend. They form the
basis of the in-game economy and are tradable in the Market.

### Food
Food is produced in Farms and is required for any action that relates to
units. For example, training Infantry or researching combat unit upgrades.

### Wood
Lumber is produced in Lumberyards and is required for upgrading any building,
constructing new buildings, and training Siege & Ranged units.

### Stone
Stone is produced in Quarries and is required for most advanced building
upgrades, some Siege units, and most building or Siege unit research nodes.

### Gold
Gold, obtained in Mines and used for all research nodes, most advanced units,
all religious units, and some advanced buildings. 

## Buildings

Buildings are divided in several categories. Categories are merely semantic
groupings and don't directly affect capabilities.

- Core
- Resources
- Research
- Combat
- Religious
- Social
- Decorative

### Core
There is a single core building, the **Keep**. It is the foundational nucleus
of the empire, and controls the maximum level all other buildings can reach.

The Keep, or Donjon, houses the ruling family and administrative staff. Thus,
increasing the level of the keep directly translates to an increase in staff 
and keep-activity capabilities.

### Resources
Resources are required to research, construct new buildings, train combat
units, etc. There are four resource buildings, which directly correlate
to the four resources:

- Farm (Food)
- Lumberyard (Wood)
- Quarry (Stone)
- Mine (Gold)

Their commonality follows their respective order. Players start with a farm 
and enough Wood and Stone to craft their first Lumberyard and Quarry. Mines 
requires both Wood and Stone.

Players may craft up to four buildings of each type.

### Research
Research buildings dictate how far along the user is in their technological
path. Higher research levels are required to unlock advanced units, improve
output of resource buildings, and even to unlock certain buildings.

There are two primary research buildings and a hybrid:

- Academy
- University
- Laboratory (Menhir/Spirit Tree)

The Academy is a military research building and focuses on improving combat
units and unlocking new units. The University handles material, economic, and
politic sciences. The Laboratory is a special hybrid that allows magic
research and also produces magical units.

Players can progress on all advancement trees at the same time, since each 
has an independent research queue.

### Military
Military, or combat, buildings allow players to train and upgrade units.
A standing army requires upkeep in the form of both Food and Gold. There are
five military buildings and one hybrid:

- Barracks
- Range
- Stable
- Workshop
- Laboratory (Menhir/Spirit Tree)
- Walls

The first four produce melee, ranged, mounted, and siege units. The 
Laboratory produces Mages (Shamans/Druids) and also doubles as its own
research building. The Wall defines the defensive capabilities of the
Empire, and allows players to garrison part of their army.

### Religious
Religion improves different aspects of the empire. Each faction may choose 
different deities that each focus on a different aspect of their civilization.
For example, a war goddess might increase training speed and combat 
effectiveness but neglects research and economic advancement, whereas a nature
god could increase output and open new research nodes but does nothing for the
military, and so on.

There are only two religious buildings:

- Church (Altar/Sacred Circle)
- Monument

The Church's level defines how effective the Deity's buffs are. The Monument is
a late-game building that enables miracles, single-use special effects.

### Social
Social buildings form the basis for P2P interaction. They enable guilds, trading,
and mutual assistance.

- Guild Hall
- Market
- Embassy

The Guild Hall enables the guild subsystem. The Market is a player-run auction
house, where users may trade resources. The Embassy allows users to send their
dignitaries to other Empires, forming defensive and offensive alliances that
enable army support.

### Decorative
And lastly, we have decorative buildings. There are non-functional buildings
that allow users to customise their empire.
